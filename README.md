# Infographic Alpine One

## Overview

**Infographic Alpine One** is an interactive HTML-based educational tool that visualizes the "Needs-Based Pedagogy" (NBP) system for teaching Scratch to students who are not yet interested in coding. The project leverages Alpine.js for reactivity and Chart.js for dynamic data visualization, enabling educators to explore and customize lesson flows and visualize how focusing on student needs can drive engagement and learning outcomes.

## Features

- **Interactive Infographic**: Visualizes the four-phase NBP lesson flow—Discover, Connect, Co-Create, Reinforce—using charts and diagrams.
- **Customizable Lesson Planning**: Users can adjust sliders to customize time allocation for each lesson phase, with real-time updates reflected in a doughnut chart.
- **Student-Need Focus**: Emphasizes a shift from delivering knowledge to fulfilling students' intrinsic needs (creative expression, problem-solving, and fun).
- **Data Visualization**: Uses Chart.js to present lesson breakdowns and needs-discovery results.
- **Teacher Mindset Framework**: Guides educators through the roles of Detective, Value Proposer, and Encourager in the NBP system.
- **Responsive Design**: Styled with Tailwind CSS for clean, adaptive presentation.

## Philosophy

The core principle is a complete shift from delivering a product (knowledge) to fulfilling a student's need for creative expression and fun. The lesson is structured like a sales cycle, moving students from disinterest to active creation by focusing entirely on their intrinsic motivations.

## Lesson Flow

The NBP lesson flow consists of four main phases:
1. **Discover**: Unpack student needs and desires without mentioning code.
2. **Connect**: Frame Scratch as the tool to bring their ideas to life.
3. **Co-Create**: Enable hands-on creation with immediate, tangible results.
4. **Reinforce**: Reflect on creations and spark curiosity for what's next.

Each phase is visually and interactively represented for both planning and pedagogical understanding.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Core markup for structure.
- **Alpine.js**: Lightweight reactivity and data-binding.
- **Chart.js**: Dynamic, interactive charts for lesson visualization.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **Google Fonts ('Inter')**: Clean and modern typography.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nikos-fa/infographic-alpine-one.git
   cd infographic-alpine-one
   ```

2. **Open the Main HTML File**
   - Open `Infogrpaphics with sliders Alpine.html` directly in your web browser (no build tools required).

3. **Explore and Customize**
   - Adjust the sliders to see how different lesson phase timings affect the overall structure.
   - Hover over charts for more details.

## Usage

- Designed for educators, curriculum designers, and workshop leaders focused on creative coding and student-driven learning.
- Can be used as a planning tool, a discussion starter, or a presentation aid.
